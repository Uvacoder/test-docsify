## Helpers

Let's be blunt - any proxy apps on the App Store are only for debugging not forwarding to your corporate proxy servers.

Apps like `Charles iOS` or `Proxyman iOS` will only let you analyse your iOS network traffic, but don't solve any proxy connection issues :disappointed:

So in short, you're tied in to native proxy settings.
